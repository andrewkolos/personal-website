Some number of months back, our team onboarded a new developer that had come right out of
a 6-month bootcamp. In preparation, I gave myself the task of creating
technical documentation of our team's primary service in hopes that it would make it easy
for the new dev to learn its architecture.

Hours were spent writing and creating diagrams. As I wrote, I continued to revise my approach.
I focused on covering data flows one-at-a-time (graying out other components on the diagrams),
then showed how components interacted, and finally I revisted details I had left out in order
to lower the reader's cognitive burden.

Before the new dev showed up, I showed it to the team and they loved it--their reaction delighted me,
and I was now even more excited to present it to the new dev. I was imagining that, with this new article
series I had produced, what had taken me over a month to learn when I was onboarding would only take
them a week.

The day came. With a couple other devs behind me, I began to walk through the first chapter. I talked
about how we had an Amazon Load Balancer forward requests to servers running in an Elastic Container Service,
which would do some simple data mapping/cleaning and forward requests to a queue for later downstream
processing, et cetera et cetera.

I was paying attention to the reactions of the new dev--they were quiet. Very quiet.
I knew this was either really good or
really bad--that I was either explaining everything very well or that they were completely lost.
I continued to focus on the reactionary cues of my audience; and, finally, they gave a clearer tell:
they rubbed their head and mouthed what I interpreted to be a "WTF."

I knew I had to stop. I reminded them that what I was explaining was pretty complicated and that they
are welcome to ask questions. Another dev, who was also fairly new, made an important observation: something along the likes of
"hey &lt;new dev&gt;, do you know what an ALB is and what EC2 is? I don't know if they taught you that
in &lt;bootcamp program&gt;." It was a horrible realization for me--how did I assume that someone pretty new
to software engineering would be fully literate in cloud services (let alone AWS ones in particular)?
In presenting my writing, I failed to recall who my audience was. It was especially embarassing, because
this is a detail I usually always account for. The document I was presenting even had the target audience
described--and yes, it assumed familiarity with common AWS computing and storage solutions.

After apologizing, I walked back and, as I got to each component, explained (at a fundamental level),
what each AWS service does while also stressing that these details didn't really matter. That is,
they could just think of a AWS Lambda symbol on a diagram as a black box that takes an input,
does some computing, and sends out a result somewhere else.

I'm grateful to my other teammate for catching my mistake as quickly as they did. I still had plenty of time
to cover all the essentials within the time we had alloted. After only a week or so, the new developer,
was contributing meaningful code to our service's code base, and they told me that they were very grateful
for the extra work I did in putting documentation together.

This whole experience was another reminder to me to [focus on my audience](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/audience)
when writing and/or presenting.
